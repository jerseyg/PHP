 1) After establishing context, a ProArc’s first objective is to master the required technical vocabulary.
Using resource two as a starting point, define the following terms and acronyms:

a) HTML5 (Hyper-Text-Markup-Language 5) The 5 version of HTML

c) URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) A String used to identify a name or a resource.

d) User Agent - Software that acts on behalf of the user. For example a web browser would be considered a user agent.

e) Origin Server - A Server where resources resides or is to be created.

f) HTTP Cookie - data sent between a web browser and the sever that is stored on the users web browser.

g) RFC (Request for comments) - a Memorandom describing methods, behaviors, research, or innovations applicable to the working of the Internet and Internet-connected systems.

h) W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) - An international community that is dedicated to developing the Web

i) IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) - Develops and promotes Internet Standards.



2) You’re itching to start debugging the protocol, but first you need to understand its history.
Referencing resource two:

a) Who developed HTTP? How was it proposed?
	Tim Berners-Lee Developed HTTP. It was proposed by Tim Berners-lee as the "WorldWideWeb" project.

b) When was HTTP developed and for what purpose?
	The first documented version of HTTP was in 1991. It was used to transfer hypertext between nodes using logical links or "HyperLinks".

c) What types of information was HTTP designed to deliver?
	HTTP is designed to deliver responces and requests to and from the server. HTTP sends a request to the server which in turn responds with a status code and content from the server.

d) HTTP is part of a “protocol stack”. What are the two protocols “below” HTTP on this stack?
	The two protocols below the HTTP on the protocol stack are TCP and IP.

3) Let the debugging begin! The protocol bug manifests itself as corrupted data-exchanges paired with one of the following error messages:

HTTP resource not modified. Status Code: 304
Method Not Allowed. Status Code: 405
I’m a Teapot. Status Code: 418

Referencing resources three and four:
a) What is an HTTP resource?
	An HTTP resource can be a file and/or output of any server-side script that resides on the server.

b) What is an HTTP status code? (Outline the available status categories and explain the status codes present in the above listed error messages.)	
	Status Codes are 3 digit numbers that return a message generated by the server or client.
	Status codes are consisted of 5 groups:
		1XX: Informational
		2XX: Successful
		3XX: Redirected
		4XX: Error on Clients Part
		5XX: Error on Servers Part
	Status Code 304: If GET request and access is allowed but the document has not be modified.
	Status Code 405: The Method specified in the Request-Line is not allowed for the resourced identified by the Request-URI
	Status Code 418: An April fools joke defined in 1998. Accessed by the Hyper-Text Coffee Pot Contorl Protocol (HTCPCP) 

4) Your research assistant just info-spiked you on The Great Hub. She’s found evidence that the status codes from Q3 have something to do with HTTP headers, methods and proxies.
Referencing resources three and five:

a) Explain the difference between HTTP GET and HTTP POST requests.
	the GET request is a CGI script sent through the URL where it can be modified and seen in the URL. POST request is a CGI script sent through the HTTP header and cannot be modified or seen in the URL. 

b) What are HTTP headers. What kind of HTTP options can be controlled using client-side and server-side HTTP headers?
	HTTP headers are the parameters of the HTTP transaction. They can be modified with server-side scripts such as php, python, RoR.

c) What do we mean when we say that HTTP is a stateless protocol?
	HTTP is a stateless protocol because HTTP does not store and data between the client and the server.
d) What is an HTTP proxy?
	an http proxy is the middle man between the client and the server or client. a HTTP proxy directs the client to the service or file it is requesting. 

e) What’s the deal with status code 418? Can it be ignored as evidence?
	An April fools joke defined in 1998. Accessed by the Hyper-Text Coffee Pot Contorl Protocol (HTCPCP)
